Reverse Engineering Authentication


Reverse engineer the starter code provided and create a tutorial for the code.
<<<<<<< HEAD

In the `Develop` folder, there is starter code for a project. Begin inspecting the code to get an understanding of each file's responsibility. Then, in a Google Doc, write a tutorial explaining *every* file and its purpose. If one file is dependant on other files, be sure to let the user know.

At the end of the tutorial, add instructions for how you could now add changes to this project.

Following the [common templates for user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story#Common_templates), we can frame this challenge as follows:

## Business Context

When joining a new team, you will be expected to inspect a lot of code that you have never seen before. Rather than having a team member explain every line for you, you will dissect the code by yourself, saving any questions for a member of your team.

## Minimum Requirements

* A link to a document or video with instructions on how what each section of code is doing in `Develop/`.

## Submission on BCS

You are required to submit the following:

* A link to a Google Doc, video, or equivalent that describes the code in `Develop/`.
